# Model Reconstruction Service

## Overview

The bacterial Model Reconstruction Service integrates and augments technologies for genome annotation, construction of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, generation of biomass reactions, reaction network assembly, thermodynamic analysis of reaction reversibility, and model optimization, to generate draft genome-scale metabolic models. The service is capable of generating functioning draft metabolic models of an organism starting from an assembled genome sequence. Additional information is available in [High-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models](https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1672.html).



## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

This module provides the following application specfication(s):
* [GapfillModel](app_specs/GapfillModel.md)
* [ModelReconstruction](app_specs/ModelReconstruction.md)
* [RunProbModelSEEDJob](app_specs/RunProbModelSEEDJob.md)
